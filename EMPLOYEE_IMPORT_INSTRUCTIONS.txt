EMPLOYEE BULK IMPORT CSV TEMPLATE - IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

⚠️  CRITICAL: DO NOT MODIFY THE HEADER ROW ⚠️

The column headers in this CSV file are in camelCase format and MUST remain 
exactly as they are. These headers match the database field names and are 
required for the import script to work correctly.

❌ DO NOT CHANGE:
   - firstName → "First Name" 
   - lastName → "Last Name"
   - dateOfBirth → "Date of Birth"
   - mobileNumber → "Mobile Number"
   - etc.

✅ KEEP AS IS:
   - firstName
   - lastName  
   - dateOfBirth
   - mobileNumber
   - etc.

================================================================================
HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE:
================================================================================

1. Open the CSV file in Excel or Google Sheets
2. DO NOT modify the first row (header row)
3. Delete the example rows (rows 2 and 3) if present
4. Fill in employee data starting from row 2
5. Save the file as CSV (UTF-8 encoding)
6. The import script will read the headers exactly as they are
